# Lessn Archive

This is a simple Node.js application to read from a database dump of [Lessn](https://github.com/shauninman/Lessn) that's been imported into Postgres so to keep the old URLs working.

# Why?
I used Lessn several years ago on Twitter as my URL shortener, before Twitter introduced their own automatic one and made it unnecessary. I still have the database dump from it but never bothered with the full Lessn setup. This allows me to keep the old URLs working without needing PHP or MySQL.
