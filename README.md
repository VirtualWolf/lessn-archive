# Lessn Archive

## Description

This is a simple [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) to read links via [Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/products/workers-kv/) that came from a database dump of [Lessn](https://github.com/shauninman/Lessn).

## Why?
I used Lessn several years ago on Twitter as my URL shortener, before Twitter introduced their own automatic one and made it unnecessary. I still have the database dump from it but never bothered with the full Lessn setup. This allows me to keep the old URLs working without needing any hosting on my side.
